# HANA Deployment

## Prerequisites

1. Bootstrap infrastructure has been deployed;
1. Bootstrap infrastructure has been configured;
1. Deployer has been configured with working Ansible;
1. SAP Library contains all media for the relevant BoM;
1. SAP infrastructure has been deployed;
1. SAP Library contains all Terraform state files for the environment;
1. Deployer has Ansible connectivity to SAP Infrastructure (e.g. SSH keys in place/available via key vault);
1. Ansible inventory has been created.

## Inputs

1. BoM file;
1. Ansible inventory that details deployed SAP Infrastructure. **Note:** Inventory contents and format TBD, but may contain reference to the SAP Library;
1. SID (likely to exist in Ansible inventory in some form);
1. Unattended install template.

## Manual process

The existing HANA SID deployment is handled manully via `HDBLCM`.

1. Install the HANA Database *:

      1. Ensure the mount point exists for the Installation Media:

         `mkdir -p /usr/sap/install`

      1. Ensure the exported Installation Media directory is mounted:

         `mount <scs-vm-IP>:/usr/sap/install /usr/sap/install`

      1. Make and change to a temporary directory:

         `mkdir /tmp/hana_install; cd $_`

      1. Ensure HDBLCM is available (adjust SERVER SAR filename to match your media):

         `/usr/sap/install/download_basket/SAPCAR.EXE -manifest SAP_HANA_DATABASE/SIGNATURE.SMF -xf /usr/sap/install/download_basket/IMDB_SERVER20_052_0-80002031.SAR`

      1. Update the HANA Installation template `/usr/sap/install/config/<BoM_Name>.params` file (where `BoM_Name` matches the HANA version to be installed, e.g. `HANA_2_00_052_v001`) and replace variables:
         1. Update `components` to `all`
         1. Update `hostname` to `<hana-vm-hostname>` for example: `hostname=hd1-hanadb-vm`
         1. Update `sid` to `<HANA SID>` for example: `sid=HD1`
         1. Update `number` to `<Instance Number>` for example: `number=00`

      1. Update the HANA Password file `/usr/sap/install/config/<BoM_Name>.params.xml` file, replacing all the ansible variables (e.g. `{{ db_root_password }}`) with a single suitable password for installation.

      1. Run the HANA installation:

         `cat /usr/sap/install/config/HANA_2_00_052_v001.params.xml | SAP_HANA_DATABASE/hdblcm --read_password_from_stdin=xml -b --configfile=/usr/sap/install/config/HANA_2_00_052_v001.params`

## Process


1. Run Ansible playbook which configures base-level OS
1. Run Ansible playbook which configures base-level SAP OS
   1. Configures OS groups and users using configurable gids/uids with viable defaults for greenfield systems
      1. `<SID>adm` user has the same uid across all systems using that SID
      1. `sapsys` user has same uid across all systems
      1. `sapadm` user has same uid across all systems
   1. Configures SAP OS prerequisites
      1. O/S dependencies (e.g. those found in SAP notes such as [2369910](https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/2369910))
      1. Software dependencies (e.g. those found in SAP notes such as [2365849](https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/2365849))
   1. Configures LVM volumes
   1. Configures generic SAP filesystem mounts
      1. Configure directory structure (e.g. `/sapmnt`, `/usr/sap`, etc.)
      1. Configure file systems (i.e. `/etc/fstab`)
1. Run Ansible playbook which processes the BoM file to obtain and prepare the correct installation media for the system
   1. Configure install directories (e.g. `/sapmnt/<SID>` and `/usr/sap/install`)
   1. Configure media directory exports
   1. Iterates over BoM content to download (media, unattended install templates, etc.)
   1. **Note:** Nested BoMs will also be iterated over, to ensure media which may be needed for the installation will also be downloaded and made available.
   1. Media will be downloaded to a known location (`/usr/sap/downloads`) on the filesystem of a particular VM and selectively extracted and organised into directories where it benefits the automated process
   1. Creates NFS export of downloaded/extracted media making available to other VMs in the system
   1. Mounts above export on other VMs
1. Run Ansible playbook which deploys stand alone SAP HANA instance (using SWPM)

## Results and Outputs

1. SAP HANA has been deployed and running;
1. Connection details/credentials so the Basis Administrator can configure HANA DB Client.
