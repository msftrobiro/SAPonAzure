SAP HANA on Azure
=================

This repository contains terraform templates to install a single node HANA instance and HANA high-availability pair. The different pieces of infrastructure are split into modules.

1. Single node HANA instance:
   Terraform will need to be run from the ` deploy/vm/modules/single_node_hana` directory. The `terraform.tfvars` files with the required configuration needs to be put in this folder. An example tfvars file can be found below. 

2. HANA high-availability pair:
   To create the infrastructure for the HA pair, terraform will be run from the `deploy/vm/modules/ha_pair` directory.  This will allow us to have new modules for each configuration of the HANA database. Currently, both of the databases, `db0` and `db1` have HANA installed. The `terraform.tfvars` files with the required configuration needs to be put in this folder. An example tfvars file can be found below.
